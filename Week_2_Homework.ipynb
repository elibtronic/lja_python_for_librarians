This data is information about DOIs registered with Cross-Ref during the month of January 2020 that match the search `information literacy`. We are going to use our Pandas skills to perform a basic analysis of the data. Check out the first few paragraphs of the DOI [entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) on Wikipedia if you haven't heard of A DOI before or if you need a refresher about what it is and how it is structured."
